## Current Status ðŸš€

The form is now ready for comprehensive end-to-end testing. All 43 fields have been implemented with proper validation, file uploads, and data persistence.

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### 1. Testing Phase
- Follow the TEST_CHECKLIST.md for comprehensive testing
- Test all 43 fields are captured correctly

- Verify admin dashboard displays all data
- Test CSV export functionality

### 2. Known Areas to Test
- Personal details validation (should now work with fixed age brackets)
- File upload progress indicators
- Multiple body image uploads
- Form data persistence on refresh
- Mobile responsiveness
- Error handling scenarios

### 3. Potential Improvements
- Add real-time form progress saving
- Implement draft/resume functionality
- Add email confirmation after submission

## Testing URLs
- Form: http://localhost:3000/questionnaire
- Admin Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/admin
- Success Page: http://localhost:3000/success

## Important Notes
1. Make sure Supabase storage bucket 'fitness-uploads' is configured
2. Ensure all environment variables are set (.env.local)
3. Clear localStorage before testing fresh submission
4. Monitor browser console for any errors
5. Check Supabase dashboard for data verification
