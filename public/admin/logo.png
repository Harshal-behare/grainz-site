# Logo Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the logo.png file.

To add your actual logo:
1. Replace this file with your actual logo image (PNG format)
2. Recommended dimensions: 200x50 pixels for header logo
3. Make sure the file is named "logo.png" and placed in the public/admin/ directory

For now, the application will work without the logo image showing.
